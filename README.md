Used primarily to easily map Packet IDs for use with our Bots.
<br><br>
### Items:
Used to map Items and their Texture Indexes/Item IDs for use with Bot Inventory moving and such.
<br><br>
### Objects:
Used to provide our bots with a map of Objects for things like Object Collision and auto aim targets
<br><br>
### Enemies
Used to parse enemies and their sizes so we know when to send Hit packets and such.
